### Team Preferences

 Our team comprises of student developers Jacob Petterle, Alec Moran, Korbin Walsh, Chase Howard, and Michael Bauers. We are all excited to see what we can accomplish as a team this semester. Our comprehensive expectation and goal for the class is to learn how to work as a team as efficiently as possible. Some possible obstacles we may encounter involve individual procrastination, group conflicts, and time constraints. Even with these potential challenges, our team subscribes to a growth mindset, where we can overcome these difficulties with clear communication along with a robust work ethic.
 
 We all share similar opinions on the distribution of the workload. It would be nice to get an A in the class, but we are more focused on putting our best work forward and delivering a high quality product. We understand that delivering a high quality product will require a large investment of work time. In all honesty, we don't know what amount of work each project will require, but we expect that we will have a better understanding once we are further along in our first sprint. We plan on distributing tasks to the individual that has the best ability to complete that task with their specific skillset. By doing that, we think we can achieve the best mileage from our time and energy. Should someone not follow through with a commitment, we decided to address the problem with them directly in order to resolve the issue smoothly and quickly. Our team will meet virtually on a weekly basis outside of class. We believe that clear, easy communication is vital for team success, so we will be frequently using our online slack channel to collaborate. 

 Overall, we are excited for the coming semester, and we look forward to what we will learn and what we will achieve together
