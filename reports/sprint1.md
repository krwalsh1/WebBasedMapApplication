# Sprint 1 - *t18* - *progRAMmers*

## Goal
### Who is the development team?
The solution should clearly identify the team that created the product and a little bit about the team members.

## Sprint Leader
### *Alec Moran*

## Definition of Done

* The team's web application is deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* The version in server/pom.xml is `<version>1.0</version>`.
* The Product Increment release for `v1.0` created on GitHub.
* The completed metrics are captured below.
* The scrums completed during each lecture are captured below.
* The sprint review and restrospective are captured below.
* The design document is updated (design.md).


## Policies

* GitHub etiquette


## Planned Epics

* Epic 1: *v1 protocol, Issue #22*
  * This epic requires the developemnt of connection visibility.
    Several different types of status will be added to the footer of the 
    webpage including *server information, connection status,* and a *more*
    *server information icon*.
* Epic 2: *Team identification, Issue #23*
  * This epic allows users to easily identify the team name. Team identity
    will appear in the *browser tab, client application,* and the *server*.
* Epic 3: *about, Issue #29*
  * This epic allows the user to view team and member information directly
    from the client. The client will display the *team mission statement*
    and *member names, images, and bios*. This will be structured according
    to the format governed by the *page skeleton task*.

## Review

#### Epics done 
All required epics were completed. (Team ID, v1 Protocol, About)

#### Epics not done 
Only the epics not required this sprint. (Where am I, Where is)

#### What went well
Communication. We did a really good job talking to one another about our individual progressions and challenges. Throughout the entire sprint we talked everyday
on the Slack channel and we were all able to attend each scrum meeting that was scheduled.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
Some slight problems within our IDE environments were encountered. We were able to delegate the tasks to another team member in order to meet the definition of done requirements. Outside of that one freak case, there weren't really any big problems encountered that inhibited our progress.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
Communication and problem solving.

#### Potential improvements
Better time allocation for our tasks. Maybe starting a little earlier will allow for less of a time crunch before the sprint is due.

#### What we will change next time
Next time, we will try to start earlier with our individual tasks so that we can get any help with code / tech issues that we may encounter.
