# Preferences for Alec Moran

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Messaging through slack is fine, texting me directly is fine [(970)420-4538], I have a headset and fiber internet so i'm also fine with discord [Discord username is a1ec], or any other voice chatting platform, all of my classes are online so I'm available whenever.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I really want to get into the nitty gritty of how software is built from start to finish, I have barely any experience with group based development so I'm eager to learn how it's done.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'm very amiable, I'd like to get to a point where my team is efficient and just flows really well so that I can apply the techniques we used again for future teams/jobs.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Time constraints for one, another obstacle I ran into with a group in the past was not assigning a problem to a person and then having two people go after it simultaneously without anyone knowing, each person took two completely different approaches each having put a decent amount of time into developing their own solution, it's very hard to pick one over the other and discard that person's hard work so its good to make sure everyone knows what needs to be done and by who.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I believe as long as we do our best work the entire time that wouldn't be a problem. Personally I'm not a heckler for pushing for grades my focus is on learning the maximum amount I can from the course.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If some teammates are contributing significantly more than other teammates to the point they are carrying the team, I think the A should go to them.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I have no idea what the project is yet but I am expecting each of us contribute 5-6 hours each per week individually so about 25-30 hours total work across the team per week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * First find out who is good at what and delegate tasks based on skills and experience in that area.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Address them directly and if they don't respond in a timely matter we take corrective action.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * The quality of work should reflect the amount of time someone put into it, so if it doesn't look like someone put as much time into it as they should then they should be asked to take another look at it and try either a new approach or adding onto what they already have.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * This is something I honestly don't have alot of experience with, I'm hoping to find this out myself by the end of the semester.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, it's important to have check-ins.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 1-2 times per week at least, I haven't tried slack's group call feature but that, discord, or just through messages on the slack channel I would be ok with. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Hopefully yes, unless one person is absent of the discussion in which I think making a decision without that individual is ok as long as they are notified ASAP of what that decision was.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We work it out until everyone agrees on it.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * This is why it's important to be an effective leader. Effective eaders will lead the team where to go but they are always making sure everyone is right behind them doing their part working towards the same goal. Leaders might have more knowledge than their peers but that doesn't mean they do it all themselves, they use their resources and their teammates to form a strategy that gets work done equally and efficiently. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * A manager tells people what to do but a leader shows them how to do it. I'm more than happy to tell or show people what to do but if I'm always stuck in that role then theres probably a good chance everyone's roles and responsibilities within the group are not that well understood and it needs to be addressed.
