# Preferences for Chase Howard

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is easy to reach me by text and email most of the day
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to be able to get through all or almost all of every sprint
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to be avaliable for all my team member and be able to communicate what they need help with fairly easily
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Team member or me not being online when problems come up and difficult topics that we need to understand better
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We will have to compromise on how far we can go as a team, especially now when it's hard to predict what will happen tomorrow
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If someone wants to push themselves to get an A then it is fine, but they should know where the rest of their team stands and be ok if they don't get help
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * At least 10 hours working either alone or as a team
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Divide the work up and have people pick what they want to do on a rotating basis so everyone gets their first choice
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should talk to them as a team and see if they took on too much and if it happens multiple times talk to Dave
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * The quality of our work should be reasonable but not too much or too little so we should talk as a team if someone's lacking or taking on too much
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as all or most of the work someone said they'd do gets done and doesn't hurt the team as a whole, work habits don't need to change 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * It may be helpful but also it probably isn't possible to do frequently
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If it's something major every team member should be involved, but if it's only something minor, like a missing comma, it's fine to ask one person or just do it
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Ask why they don't agree and work on getting everyone to agree
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask if they'll slow down or distribute the work out more evenly and if they just keep doing too much talk to Dave
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Talk to my team and ask if they'll take on more so we stay working as a team and not let a single person start taking on all the work
