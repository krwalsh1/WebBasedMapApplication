# Preferences for Scott Sparks

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text/slack is best for time sensitive material, but I regularly check my email. Text is best during for days and nights, email I check in the evenings.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * In terms of products that we produce, I don't know what to expect. I do expect for everyone to learn to work together effectively and learn the varius tools that are part of the curriculum. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I have relatively little experience with group projects in this field, so I am excited to grow in my ability to understand my place in a team. I also plan on improving my responsiveness and timeliness with project related communications.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * To be honest, I think procrastination is something that I will have to fully purge this semester for this class. It's been something that I've made a lot of progress with the past few years, but it looks like I will have to fully get rid of it to be successful with my team.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * In short, the team will more than likely get a "B". This would be a source of friction for the team, where some people are willing to work harder than others. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't know about acceptable, but it definetely does not seem fair for some individuals to work harder and then everyone gets to reap the reward of an "A" grade.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I don't have a good idea of the specific amount of time, but I'm guessing it will be a lot more than an average CS course.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * After we have a good understanding of who has what skills, we could use that information to coordinate a project plan that focuses on our strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Clear communication is key. It's important to give the impression that commitment is important, and to adress the ways that we are not exhibiting commitment. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This can be another point of friction for the team. When there are differing oppinions on the quality of work, I would suggest referring to the specs and expectations of the product and see if that can help establish some quality threshold. If there is not enough detail in the specs, I would suggest simply talking about where everyone wants to take the project and have a discussion.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * If work habits of individuals don't affect anyone, then they don't need to be addressed. If it is holding the team back in some way, I would probably bring it up to them and talk through why they are working the way they are. I believe understanding their point of view is vital to coming to an understanding.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * For a project as long term as this, I find a lot of value in having a routine weekly meeting time.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I honestly don't know because I am still unaware of the size of the projects, but maybe a couple times a week outside of class.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It depends on the decision, but in general, the more approval the better.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Again, further discussion is likely needed to understand everyone's perspective. If the person still won't budge after discussion, then some sort of compromise from both sides is needed.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If this becomes a problem, I would probably ask them why they feel the need to take charge. I would also ask the other members of the group how they think the situation could improve.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * To be honest, it would feel like a lot of team projects I've done in the past. I would likely try to divide up the responsibilities to other members, like appointing one person to take charge of a team meeting, or selecting someone take the first action step in a project.
